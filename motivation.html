  <h1>Weekly Motivation</h1>

  <blockquote>Week 1: "Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try."</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Week 2: "Push yourself because no one else is going to do it for you."</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Week 3: "The only way to define your limits is by going beyond them."</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Week 4: "Strength doesn't come from what you can do; it comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't."</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Week 5: "Keep going. Everything you need will come to you at the perfect time."</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Week 6: "You've come too far to quit now. Finish strong!"</blockquote>
